# :pushpin: Weather-App

Hello! Diego here,

This project is a simple **Weather-APP main page** and was carried out during the FrontStart course in order to learn basic **HTML** and **CSS** functions. With this project I also learned how to create commits to **GIT** and how to edit and create a good **README**.
